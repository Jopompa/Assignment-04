# Assignment 04
## UX Storytelling 
UX storytelling allows people to see the perspective of a user and the factors that lead them to use online web pages and mobile applications. It reduces any bias researchers have when developing/altering layouts and processes, and it also allows the research team to be on the same page in terms of understanding user issues. Being that I am working on making it easier for tasks to be conducted on Alaska's Department of Fish and Game website, users' stories will allow me to get a better understanding of how and why users prefer one layout over another. Ultimately UX Storytelling will benefit the local Alaskan people as well as out of state tourists who plan on doing outdoor activities.
