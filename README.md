## UX Storytelling 
UX storytelling allows people to see the perspective of a user and the factors that lead them to use online web pages and mobile applications. It reduces any bias researchers have when developing/altering layouts and processes, and it also allows the research team to be on the same page in terms of understanding user issues. Being that I am working on making it easier for tasks to be conducted on Alaska's Department of Fish and Game website, users' stories will allow me to get a better understanding of how and why users prefer one layout over another. Ultimately UX Storytelling will benefit the local Alaskan people as well as out of state tourists who plan on doing outdoor activities.

# Scenarios and Journey Maps
## 1. Brianna's Scenario and Journey Map 
### Why? 
Being an experienced traveler Brianna is aware that state’s departmental web pages are the best resources for finding tourist information. After thinking about what kind of things she needs to look up, she would like to go on the Department of Fish and Game website to see where, when, and how wild animals are out in nature. All she really wants are some location names and the best time to go view. Alaska is a big state so she would like to search locations based on the type of animals that inhabit the area.

### How? 
Brianna is a full time warehouse worker and mom, so she doesn’t have a lot of time to plan her trips outside of her work breaks. So in between her 20 and 45 min breaks she pulls out her Ipad and gets to work. She goes to the homepage of Alaska’s Department of Fish and Game and scrolls up and down the page to search for subcategories relating to wildlife. After discovering there is a viewing wildlife category she hovers over it and looks to see if there are location and animal type subcategories.

## 2. Zinnia's Scenario and Journey Map
### Why? 
Being a cautious traveler Zinnia makes sure she has a hold of any emergency services she might need while being out in a different state. Since she’s going to be in the wilderness this time she searches for the Wildlife Encounter Report Form in case any issues with wildlife pop up. Also she wants to have the most direct way of contacting Alaska's Wildlife authorities.

### How? 
Zinnia has an Iphone 8 plus while she is out in Alaska and is using it to fill out the Wildlife Encounter Report Form. She is in the middle of the wilderness when she is filling it out so online service is very limited. She does have a trail map to reference the trail she is on but does not have a physical map or qualitative online map to reference the city and or area she is in. It is also the winter time in Alaska and Zinnia’s fingers feel numb after removing her gloves to type information on the phone so the longer her hands are out of the gloves the more typing becomes inconvenient for her. She begins by clicking on the report a wildlife encounter form on the home page, then filling out each question one by one.
